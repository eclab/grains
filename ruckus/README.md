# Ruckus

Ruckus is a noise generator.  Ruckus is meant to run on the AE Modular GRAINS, but it could be adapted to any Arduino.

Ruckus can make pure white noise, pulse noise, or white noise pushed through a 12DB lowpass, high pass, or bandpass filter where you can specify the cutoff frequency and resonance.  Not a lot of resonance, mind you, or the filter is overwhelmed.

## Pulse noise 

This is just noise which consists entirely of maximum (5V) or minimum (0V) values.  It sounds something like white noise but I can make it much louder.

## Configuration
