This directory contains the Dave application for your laptop.  You can find binaries for MacOS, Windows, and Linux in the "install" subdirectory.  

If you want to build this from source and are proficient in Java, the easiest way is to just install the two jar files in the libraries directory, and then compile Dave.java.  That's it!
