This directory contains the source code for the Dave application for your laptop.  

You're probably looking for binaries.  They are here:

* [Dave.app.zip](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/dave/Dave.app.zip) for MacOS
* [dave.jar](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/dave/dave.jar) for Windows and Linux.

To install and run these binaries, follow the same instructions as those found for [Edisyn](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn).  Notably, Windows and Linux users will have to install java.

If you want to build this from source and are proficient in Java, the easiest way is to just install the two jar files in the libraries directory, and then compile the .java files.  Then run java Dave.  That's it!
