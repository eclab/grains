This directory contains two files:

Dave.app.zip		For Mac Users
Dave.jar		For Windows and Linux Users

Windows and Linux users need to install Java.  The installation process is identical to the process described in [Edisyn](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn), another program I wrote.  Go there for instructions.

The [Edisyn](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn) page also has information about installing for the Mac, you should check it out.
