/// MODE16
///
/// Mode16 adds patterns to the SEQ16 sequencer similar to SEQ8's "MODE CV" feature.   
/// You can make the sequencer go backwards, go once and end, ping-pong, do random sequences,
/// skip steps, insert rests, and more.
///
///
/// SET GRAINS TO GRAINS MODE.
///
/// You will need to install the Mozzi Library.  You can do this from the Library Manager
/// in your Arduino IDE.
///
/// How does Mode16 perform this magic?  By controlling SEQ16's gate and manually stepping it.
/// Mode16 can make the SEQ16 move to any location, then play its note; or it can make the SEQ16
/// play a rest.  For example, the make the SEQ16 play location 10, Mode16 will reset SEQ16,
/// then step it 9 times, then step it once to play it.  (Yes coders, this ia O(n^2), not cheap).
///
/// But during those 9 steps, how does Mode16 prevent SEQ16 from playing?  This is done by filtering
/// out the output gate.  You attach the SEQ16's gate out to Mode16, and then Mode16 provides the
/// actual gate.  
///
/// Mode16 comes with 12 repeating or one-shot PATTERNS.  You can change them if you are careful.
/// The patterns at present are:
///
/// Play 16 steps, looping
/// Play 16 steps, play them again, and then end
/// Play 16 steps backwards, looping
/// Ping-Pong, looping
/// Random walk, looping
/// Random notes, looping
/// Play the first 8 notes, then 8 random notes from back 8, looping
/// AABA: Play the first 8 notes twice, then the second 8, then the first 8 again, looping
/// Rests: Play the first 8 notes with interspersed rests, then the back 8 (without rests) twice, looping
/// Play 16 steps with 1/2 probability random dropouts, looping
/// Play a random note, or a rest, looping
/// Play 16 steps with swing, looping
///
/// 
/// SETTING UP
///
/// 0. Be sure to set your GRAINS to "GRAINS" mode, not Mozzi
/// 1. Connect Mode16's Clock Out (Digital Out or "D") to SEQ16's Clock
/// 2. Connect Mode16's Reset Out (Audio Out) to SEQ16's Reset
/// 3. Connect SEQ16's Gate Out to Mode16's Gate In (IN 3)
/// 4. Connect your clock source to Mode16's Clock In (IN 1), set POT 1 to max, and set its switch to IN 1
/// 5. Connect your reset source to Mode16's Reset In (IN 2), set POT 2 to max, and set its switch to IN 2
/// 6. Connect Mode16's Gate Out (Audio In) to your gate output
/// 7. Turn POT 3 to select the pattern.
/// 8. Send Reset to Mode16 (IN 1) to reset SEQ16 rather than directly to the SEQ16.  Similarly, send
///    Clock to Mode16 (IN 2) to clock SEQ16 rather than directly to the SEQ16.
/// 9. Take the CV from SEQ16 but the Gate from Mode16's Gate Out (Audio In).
///
///
/// GOTCHAS
///
/// Mode16 expects a square-wave-ish clock.  During the LOW PART of the square wave, it does all
/// the clocks to forward to the proper step, then on the RISE of the square wave it plays the note.
/// The problem with this approach is that during the low part of the square wave is when the release of your
/// note plays, so if you have anything other than a very short release, you'll hear the other pitches as 
/// Mode16 advances to the proper step.  You can adjust things by tweaking the PWM of the square
/// wave you send to Mode16.
///
/// Mode16 is incompatible with Accent Repeats, because they conflict with Mode16's because SEQ16 determines how fast 
/// to play them (even a single Repeat) based on the speed of previous pulses, and Mode16 pulses very fast to move
/// to different locations.  So Mode16 has special code to ignore Accent Repeats and treat them as a single standard
/// gate.
///
/// Note that if you set the Pattern Knob to in-between two patterns, it won't work right, constantly getting 
/// reset.  So make sure the Pattern Knob is definitely on the pattern you want.
///
/// PROGRAMMING
///
/// Mode16 has 12 patterns in the array called "patterns" below.  Each pattern can be at most 64
/// elements long.  A pattern MUST end with either "END" or "LOOP" -- if it does not, bad things will happen.
/// Likewise, don't have a LOOP without any PLAY or REST elements prior to it at all, else you'll have an infinite loop.
/// Mode16 runs through all the elements of the chosen pattern in order.  The elements are:
///
/// END			Stop and do not continue
///	LOOP		Go back to the start of the pattern.
/// PLAY		Play the current step and advance it.
/// REST		Don't play anything, don't advance.  Just wait.
/// RR			If this appears before PLAY, then with 1/2 probability we won't play the note (but still advance).
/// SKIP		If this appears before PLAY, we skip one step first.  Multiple SKIPs or SSs or RSs will skip multiple steps.
/// SS			If this appears before PLAY, we skip one step first with a 1/2 probability.   Multiple SKIPs or SSs or RSs will skip multiple steps.
/// RS			If this appears before PLAY, we skip two steps BACKWARD with a 1/2 probability.  This is used for random walks.  Multiple SKIPs or SSs or RSs will skip multiple steps.
/// J1 ... J16	If this appears before PLAY, then we jump to step 1...16 and play *that* note instead of the current note.
/// JRND		If this appears before PLAY, then we jump to a random step and play *that* note instead of the current note.
/// JR1 		If this appears before PLAY, then we jump to a random step between 1...8 and play *that* note instead of the current note.
/// JR9 		If this appears before PLAY, then we jump to a random step between 9...16 and play *that* note instead of the current note.
/// JLO1 ... JLO16	If this appears before JRND, then it changes the low bound for the next JRND
/// JHI1 ... JHI16	If this appears before JRND, then it changes the high bound for the next JRND
