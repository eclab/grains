Theese are versions of most, but not all, of the Prophet VS waves.

Note that waves 126, 127, and beyond cannot be real VS waves, since its relevant wave values stop at 125.  These are additional waves drawn from the collection I found at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ja0tc8wn6cnudzj/AACYqe2mjrWU2CeXIttm6MhOa

They may be part of the "additional waves" found in the Korg Wavestation.  John Bowen (!!!) tells me that these waves were likely from a hard drive at Sequential and didn't make it onto the original VS.  But I'm not positive.

Note that there are holes in the remaining range 1...125.  I cannot explain why those waves are missing.
